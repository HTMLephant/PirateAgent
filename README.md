# PirateAgent

Matthew Cochrane

The purpose of this project was to create an intelligent agent which could play a Treasure Hunt game with 100% accuracy. The code that was given includes the game logic and a map generator. I created the intelligent agent using deep-Q learning.

Computer scientists write and improve upon code so a given functionality can be provided to an individual, a business, or society at large. They are important because without them there would be no internet, and no programming languages to write the internet in the first place. When I approach a problem in computer science, I like to break the logic down in subcomponents and write those down as pseudocode. Then, line by line I will try to translate that into code that the computer can understand. It does not always work that way and most of the time I am just staring at the screen thinking. My ethical responsibilities include: protecting user data, purging malicious content, and ensuring the code is seucre while providing all required functionality.
